Pull requests are very welcome!

Some things to keep in mind when developing on Memorizr:

1. There is a good test coverage for the Ruby code.
So make sure that newly written code is guided by unit tests.
2. Code climate is used for code analysis.
Make sure that newly written code is of good enough quality.
But don't hesitate to make a pull request. I will comment and give my feedback.
3. Please take into acount the Ruby coding guidelines,
keep your lines of code short, don't commit unnecessary whitespace etc..
4. Some of the code is written a few years ago.
Please feel free to bring it back to the now!]
When changing in a file, try to get rid of some of the old dust,
like changing the should to expect in Rspec.
5. The Javascript is not unit tested. But feel free to set up something for it!
